We eat, drink, sleep and most importantly love **DevOps**. We are working towards strategies for standardizing architecture while ensuring security for the infrastructure. We are strong believer of the philosophy <b>Bigger problems are always solved by breaking them into smaller manageable problems</b>. Resonating with microservices architecture, it is considered best-practice to run database, cluster, storage in smaller <b>connected yet manageable pieces</b> within the infrastructure. 

This module is basically combination of [Terraform open source](https://www.terraform.io/) and includes automatation tests and examples. It also helps to create and improve your infrastructure with minimalistic code instead of maintaining the whole infrastructure code yourself.

We have [*fifty plus terraform modules*][terraform_modules]. A few of them are comepleted and are available for open source usage while a few others are in progress.




## Prerequisites

This module has a few dependencies: 

- [Terraform 0.13](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html)
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- [github.com/stretchr/testify/assert](https://github.com/stretchr/testify)
- [github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/modules/terraform](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest)







## Examples


**IMPORTANT:** Since the `master` branch used in `source` varies based on new modifications, we suggest that you use the release versions [here](https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-aws-sftp/releases).


### Simple Example
Here is an example of how you can use this module in your inventory structure:
```hcl
  module "sftp" {
        source                    = "clouddrove/sftp/aws"
        version                   = "0.15.0"
        name                      = "sftp"
        environment               = "test"
        label_order               = ["name", "environment"]
        key_path                  = "~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"
        user_name                 = "ftp-user"
        enable_sftp               = true
        s3_bucket_id              = clouddrove_dev_s3_bucket
        endpoint_type             = "PUBLIC"
        }
```






## Inputs

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|------|---------|:--------:|
| attributes | Additional attributes (e.g. `1`). | `list(any)` | `[]` | no |
| delimiter | Delimiter to be used between `organization`, `environment`, `name` and `attributes`. | `string` | `"-"` | no |
| enable\_sftp | Set to false to prevent the module from creating any resources. | `bool` | `true` | no |
| endpoint\_type | The type of endpoint that you want your SFTP server connect to. If you connect to a VPC (or VPC\_ENDPOINT), your SFTP server isn't accessible over the public internet. If you want to connect your SFTP server via public internet, set PUBLIC. Defaults to PUBLIC | `string` | `"PUBLIC"` | no |
| environment | Environment (e.g. `prod`, `dev`, `staging`). | `string` | `""` | no |
| identity\_provider\_type | The mode of authentication enabled for this service. The default value is SERVICE\_MANAGED, which allows you to store and access SFTP user credentials within the service. API\_GATEWAY. | `string` | `"SERVICE_MANAGED"` | no |
| key\_path | Name  (e.g. `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`). | `string` | `""` | no |
| label\_order | Label order, e.g. `name`,`application`. | `list(any)` | `[]` | no |
| managedby | ManagedBy, eg 'CloudDrove'. | `string` | `"hello@clouddrove.com"` | no |
| name | Name  (e.g. `app` or `cluster`). | `string` | `""` | no |
| public\_key | Name  (e.g. `ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQD3F6tyPEFEzV0LX3X8BsXdMsQ`). | `string` | `""` | no |
| repository | Terraform current module repo | `string` | `"https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-aws-sftp"` | no |
| s3\_bucket\_id | The landing directory (folder) for a user when they log in to the server using their SFTP client. | `string` | n/a | yes |
| sub\_folder | Landind folder. | `string` | `""` | no |
| tags | Additional tags (e.g. map(`BusinessUnit`,`XYZ`). | `map(any)` | `{}` | no |
| user\_name | User name for SFTP server. | `string` | n/a | yes |
| vpc\_id | VPC ID | `string` | `""` | no |

## Outputs

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| id | The Server ID of the Transfer Server (e.g. s-12345678). |
| tags | A mapping of tags to assign to the resource. |
| transfer\_server\_endpoint | The endpoint of the Transfer Server (e.g. s-12345678.server.transfer.REGION.amazonaws.com). |




## Testing
In this module testing is performed with [terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest) and it creates a small piece of infrastructure, matches the output like ARN, ID and Tags name etc and destroy infrastructure in your AWS account. This testing is written in GO, so you need a [GO environment](https://golang.org/doc/install) in your system. 

You need to run the following command in the testing folder:
```hcl
  go test -run Test
```
